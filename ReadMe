# LCEMonitor App

This repository contains a basic SwiftUI app that fetches dispatch information from the Lebanon County Emergency Services website.

## Building

Open the project in Xcode (iOS 17 or later) and run `LCEMonitorApp` on an iOS device or simulator. The app polls `https://www.lcdes.org/monitor.html` every 30 seconds and displays the parsed events in a list.
